0.0.6 / 2014-02-05

* Added Credit Card PAN validator.
* Added script (./bin/build.php) to populate default translation file.
* All Exceptions now extend \gajus\vlad\exception\Vlad_Exception.

0.0.5 / 2014-01-20

* Syntax change. Removed "failure_scenario" option. The latter was useful only to edge case scenarios and resulted in non-intuitive test scripts.
* Validator's getMessage and getMessages methods changed to static. This is done because message collection is independant of instance and to assist unit testing.

0.0.4 / 2014-01-18

* Added phpunit.xml
* Integrated with travis, https://travis-ci.org/gajus/vlad
* Integrated with coveralls, https://coveralls.io/r/gajus/vlad
* Bug fixes.
* \gajus\vlad\Vlad renamed to \gajus\vlad\Doctor to avoid ambiguity between package name and the class.
* \gajus\vlad\Result class removed. Instead \gajus\vlad\Routine::assess() returns an array errors.

0.0.3 / 2014-01-12

* Added Validator::getMessages() method.
* Test is using newly introduced Validator::asses() method. Contrary to Validator::validate(), asses method returns instance of Error, which allows internal validator chaining (e.g. Email validator could use Host validator).

0.0.2 / 2014-01-11

* Validator $options separated into $default_options and $instance_options. Restricted direct access to the $options array.
* Added "Regex" validator: value must match against provided pattern.
* Added "strict" and "c14n" options to In validator.
* Added composer.json.
* Changed namespace from ay\ to gajus\ to match the Github repository.

0.0.1 / 2014-01-10

* Translation input format changed. 'validator_error' is now provided in a format ['validator\class' => ['error_name' => ['error message v1', 'error message v2']]].
* Added "Range" validator: value must be less and/or greater that the supplied value.
* Added "In" validator: value must be in a supplied array.
* Added i18l/en.php, an example translation file.

0.0.0 / 2014-01-09

* Starting change log.
* Added failure scenario “silent”.
* Removed \ay\vlad\Result::getPassed() and \ay\vlad\Result::getAll(). \ay\vlad\Result::getFailed() and \ay\vlad\Result::filter() merged into one.
* Added "Equal" validator: value must be equal to the supplied value.
* Added "Match" validator: value must be equal to the value resolved using another selector.
* Input::getSubject() is now expecting string selector representation instead of Selector instance.
